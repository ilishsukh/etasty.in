Welcome to etasty.in. A technology startup to change the way people buy fish and meat, especially in Kolkata now. 
We are a bunch of engineers who love to code, love to cook, and of course, loves to eat. Staying at more than 14 
years at Garia,ruby,salt lake and kasba and many places in Kolkata, We have had one common experience seen in common
people like us, we go to the market in the morning or evening to buy vegetable, fish, chicken, mutton, milk. This doesn't change
for a long period of time and until we have the same things.
We sat together and ask why do people go to the market almost every day or withing 2-3 times? 
We listed down all possible reason( That's what we thought) in order after discussion with countless beer and whiskey :-)

Direct consumer problems

1. habits
2. Cost
2. Seeing and believing
3. get fresh product 
4. trust with someone to deliver a quality product
5. the possibility of the negotiated price  
5. time spend,
6. happiness, meeting people 
Indirect problems like lack of proper supply chain management, distribution, poor communication, trust, modern delivery system, old trading practice, etc also a major factor. 

You might be tempted to know why we put habits a top priority. We will soon realize that this is the only reason to go market. rest all problems are due to habits only. Let me explain.

Any habits can be broken down into three activities
1. Motivation 
2. Ability 
3. trigger

Well, this is not my theory. A well-known book called "tiny habits" by -  professor in the technology labs at Stanford University, the BJ Fogg,  explained a behavior model called "fogg model". We believe this theory can be applied to any habits people have. We applied the same here and we saw that,

Well, here is the fog model explanation of going to market 
1. Motivation - price, quality, freshness, quick availability 
2. Ability - the capability of understanding good quality like seeing and buying
3. reward -     happiness,joy meeting other people in the market

Let me put this in a graph model

You see any of the changes in any area could break the habit. Let have an example. if you don't get a good price or quality or freshness, your motivation breaks, and don't want to go

again, you get a good price, quality, or freshness but if are unable to go to market due to some time constraints or current situation like a pandemic or inability to move, you won't go to market

and finally, the reward is the joy of getting a good quality product, happiness. also spending time, certainly, you don't want to go to a very crowded place where u cant spend time with shopkeepers or your friends, you won't go.

We see that these three criteria never meet at a time, we are unsatisfied, hopeless but still, we go to market because there is no alternative and some cases a long term habits you build. 

We want to change these habits but fulfilling all these to a new habit of shopping online sitting at your home. We do understand, we can not replace everything from offline to online but certain items like fish, chicken, and mutton can be planned in little ahead to avoid time waste or delay delivery while ensuring that all motivation like price, quality, freshness is meet. We take the heavy activity ability like going market to less activity like click and pay at home.and finally you once you get the happiness and joy of getting quality, you make a new habit with us.

That's is our motivation, vision, and goal for future the to change the way Bengalis buy hilsa fish.  In our blog, we will explain why did we go to sell ilish (hilsa )? read out our blog.
